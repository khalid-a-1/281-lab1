# CS 281: Intro to Computer Systems

## Lab01 â€“ Intro

#### Overview

The objective of this lab is to introduce you to the environment that we will be using as part of the hardware lab
sequence in this course. In particular, you will learn about the breadboard prototyping stations and about the
Arduino, a system for supporting embedded processor control. We will start by exploring the features of the
breadboard and then will integrate use of the Arduino with the breadboard. You are to write a lab report that is
to be submitted by the Wednesday (in class) following the lab. It should include sections for an introduction,
methodology or experiment setup, results, and conclusion. You should answer any questions asked below as
part of your lab report. Assume your audience for the lab report are reasonably intelligent sixth graders.
